Riced Experiment 3 of Intelligent agents using qtpy and QT designer.

Implemented a minimax player that can't lose at this game, if you win against the AI please report the issue or fix it and send a pr. I know it's not clean or well documented, that's cause it's just for college term work.

To run the program, install the requirements and run [ttt_2player.py](./ttt_2player.py) for 2 player or [ttt_auto.py](./ttt_auto.py) for playing against AI.

Here's a demo of it on [Imgur](https://i.imgur.com/UkYjKYm.mp4).


Licensing wise, you can use it for anything other than submitting this as the 3rd Exp of IA for this sem. Pls don't.
